# CUSTOMER-CHUNK-ANALYSIS
The Problem: The business currently suffers from a "data visibility gap," meaning they cannot identify why or when customers are leaving until after they have already canceled their services.

The Technical Solution: A multi-layered dashboard was developed using Power Query for data transformation and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculating critical business metrics like the Churn Rate % and Total Revenue Loss.

AI-Powered Insights: Unlike a standard report, this project utilizes a Key Influencers Algorithm. This built-in machine learning logic analyzes variables like contract types and payment methods to determine the mathematical probability of a customer leaving.
